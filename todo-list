## TODO

- need to address the design
  - currently, everything is deployed as a single TF apply
  - per our original design, cosmos and ACR have separate lifecyles from the app / webv

- verify TF and quick start setup are identical (or document deltas)
  - may need to scrub names

- update readme with changes

- Web Deploy
  - ACR ci-cd webhook is setup - need to test
  - docker container logging isn't enabled

- there is an error in the app service log
  - the first time the app starts, key vault isn't set and you get a usage message
    - can we add timing to prevent?

- need to check all the logs to see if we're getting any timing errors
  - tf-state file is pushed before TF completes, so it's not really backed up
    - I delayed it as long as I could, but it's not the latest
    - should be a separate TF step

- we should be able to use an object for the dashboard variables so we only have to pass one variable instead of each individually

- module readme files need to be updated and regenerated

- need to test dashboard and alerts to make sure they are the same between manual setup and terraform setup

- scrub for naming / consistency / variables (we have a LOT)

- option to deploy to AKS is missing (I think this is OK - especially for this release)
