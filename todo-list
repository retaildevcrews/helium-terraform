## TODO

- Web Deploy
  - the image is pulled from docker hub
    - pull image from ACR using Key Vault credentials
  - ACR ci-cd webhook is setup - need to test
  - docker container logging isn't enabled

- there is an error in the app service log
  - the first time the app starts, key vault isn't set and you get a usage message
    - can we add timing to prevent?

- need to check all the logs to see if we're getting any timing errors

- module readme files need to be updated and regenerated

- need to test dashboard and alerts to make sure they are the same between manual setup and terraform setup

- option to deploy to AKS is missing (I think this is OK - especially for this release)
