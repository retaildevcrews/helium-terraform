## Prepare you helium-iac repo for rollout:

``` bash

# Initialize your terraform providers:

tf init

# Format your terraform files:

tf fmt -recursive

# Validate the terraform code is ready to apply:

* terraform validate -recursive

# If you have no errors you can apply the resources:

tf apply

# You must answer "yes" to 'Enter a value:' to create the resources

# Log into the Azure portal and browse your four new resource groups, application insights instances and Dashboards created for each of the container instances you created
